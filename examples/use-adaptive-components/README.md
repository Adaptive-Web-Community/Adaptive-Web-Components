# Using Adaptive Components

Adaptive Web Components can be used in plain html with any framework, just like native platform elements (`button`, `input`, etc.).

This example illustrates using the components in html with JavaScript to adjust Adaptive UI look and feel.

## Key features

- Register components and use in plain html
- Set component attributes and handle events
- Adjust Adaptive UI for a variety of visual treatments
- The color system uses recipes to apply color to components
- The layering system forms the visual structure of your app, including applying the luminance value (light or dark modes)
