# Adaptive UI Explorer

The Adaptive UI Explorer is an app for visualizing the effects of changing design token values and recipe configurations.

Currently the app is mostly illustrative of the color recipes, but it will soon be evolving into more of an editor for design system configuration, similar to what the Figma plugin provides within Figma.
